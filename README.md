# Creating-SVM-model-from-scratch-with-Feature-Selection-algorithm

In this Proect, I created a SVm model for the classification and use backward OLS fitted feature selection. I use the p-values of the OLS fitting to determine if a feature is important or
not by comparing it with 0.05 values. The dataset is taken from kaggle which is mainly for the breast cancer detection problem. I also removed features that have high correlations with
other features in this dataset. Mainly this algorithm is built for the classification and can easily modified for the reggression.
