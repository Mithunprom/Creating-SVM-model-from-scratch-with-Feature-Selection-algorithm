# Creating-SVM-model-from-scratch-with-Feature-Selection-algorithm

In this project, I created an SVM model for the classification and use backward OLS fitted feature selection. I use the p-values of the OLS fitting to determine if a feature is important or
not by comparing it with 0.05 values. The dataset is taken from Kaggle which is mainly for the breast cancer detection problem. I also removed features that have high correlations with
other features in this dataset. Mainly, this algorithm is built for classification and can easily be modified for regression.
